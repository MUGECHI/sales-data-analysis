#  Sales Data Analysis Project

# Overview
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of retail sales data to uncover trends in revenue, customer behavior, and product performance.  
It demonstrates practical use of **SQL, Python, and Business Intelligence tools** in a real-world analytics workflow.

# Objectives
- Analyze sales performance over time  
- Identify top-performing product categories  
- Understand customer demographics and behavior  
- Build reusable queries and visual dashboards  

---

# Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** – data storage, querying, views, and aggregations  
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib) – data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- **Metabase** – interactive dashboards and filters  
- ** Excel** – data sources

# Visualizations
The analysis produced multiple visual outputs, including:
- Monthly sales trend line chart  
- Product category sales breakdown
